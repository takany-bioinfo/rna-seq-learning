## Introduction  

This notebook is designed for performing NGS analysis using Google Colab. It considers the limitations of the free Colab environment, such as limited storage capacity and potential session disconnections from sessions.

Please note that while public datasets are used in this notebook, they are not directly related to the original studies or authors.  
The analyses presented here are intended solely for private learning purposes and are not meant for citation, reproducibility, or evaluation of any original research.

## About this notebook
This notebook preprocesses *Arabidopsis thaliana*  **paired-end** RNA-Seq public data for subsequent differential gene expression **(DGE) analysis**.   In this pipeline, RNA-Seq data are obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and processed through a partial streaming via piped inputs to generate BAM files for each sample. These BAM files are quantified collectively using **featureCounts**. Quality trimming is performed automatically using **fastp**, and mapping is conducted using **HISAT2**. To minimize storage usage, intermediate files are not saved. Execution logs are stored on Google Drive. All processing steps are executed within a single `%%bash` cell. 
<br>
###  Google Drive files
The following files are expected to be located in a specific folder on Google Drive :

- `accession_list.txt`  
- `araport11.gtf`   
- `at_index1.ht2` ÔΩû `at_index8.ht2` 

### Reference files

- `accession_list.txt` :
This file contains the accession IDs of the RNA-Seq data to be analyzed.
A total of 9 accession IDs are listed.

- `araport11.gtf` :
Arabidopsis thaliana gene annotation file.
Download from:
https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/file?path=Genes/Araport11_genome_release/Araport11_GTF_genes_transposons.20241001.gtf.gz  
After extraction, please rename the file to araport11.gtf.

- `at_index*.ht2` :
HISAT2 genome index files for *Arabidopsis thaliana*, built with splice site and exon annotations. <br>
There are 8 files, named from at_index.1.ht2 to at_index.8.ht2.  
This index set is reused from **the output of the rna-seq_01 run**.

<br>

## RNA-seq data files
The RNA-Seq data represent **various stages of pollen development** in ***Arabidopsis thaliana*** and are publicly available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
